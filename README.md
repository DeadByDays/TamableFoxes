SpigotMC Plugin that gives you the ability to tame foxes!
</p>

### WARNING: Do not reload the plugin, you may loose foxes!!
#### NOTE: You no longer need to add the program arguments to your start file. If you previously had them, you can delete them, but I don't think it would harm if you leave them in.

<small>The plugin by default submits anonymous stats about your server (player count, plugin/server version and type) to a public statistics websites (bstats.org) in order to provide the developers with usage information. If you wish to opt out, you can do so in the `bstats/config.yml` file.
